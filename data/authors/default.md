Hello, I am Wendy Chan and I am currently a Web3 Developer

I started my Software Engineering career in 2019

I am interested in Javascript React, Web3, Full Stack Development and also music

I am also a polyglot in programming languages, I got some experience in Java, Python, Golang, C# as well

I started this blog in 2022, hoping to turn what I learnt into something easy to explain
