This is not my first attempt to start a static blog, I think I started a blog with Hugo maybe two years ago, but I didn’t keep it up

I think one of the reason for me to fuck this up is because there’s some friction for me to maintain a blog repo, as I don’t want to open my repository everytime I start a blog, I would rather write this to some place centralized like Notion (together with my other todos and private notes)

I’m going to show you to fastest way to build a static blog site with Notion as the CMS (kind of), and sync your blogs written in Notion to your blog site

This involves writing a script to sync your Notion pages on a database to markdown files in your blog repository

## But first, why writing a blog?

I think the primary reason is that I want to keep up a hobby and develop my skill to deliver a concept to others more smoothly

Think of this blog as a “rehearsal” for me to talk about some idea, this will help organize my thinking flow

Study notes might seem like a great option, but it’s not that presentable to others to understand a concept

## Other solutions

I have tried Super, but it cannot be customized for free but it could fully support features of Notion

And my experience with Super wasn’t smooth either, sometimes it’s not showing the most updated post, its behavior is a little bit unpredictable

There are some blogs already mentioning how to integrate your Notion database to a blog site:

[https://dev.to/solomon04/build-a-blog-powered-by-nextjs-notion-api-57pj](https://dev.to/solomon04/build-a-blog-powered-by-nextjs-notion-api-57pj)

This blog does give a great intro to integrate Notion API, but it’s not really a static website, every time the client request a page, it will call the api directly to Notion, which might hit a limit very quickly

[https://dev.to/koddr/using-the-notion-page-as-a-personal-website-with-your-domain-on-cloudflare-1pi7](https://dev.to/koddr/using-the-notion-page-as-a-personal-website-with-your-domain-on-cloudflare-1pi7)

This blog introduces Cloudflare workers to cache the page, which will not overload the Notion API, but however, I do not see this as the fastest way to build a blog site

## Common way to bootstrap a site quickly

That is using a SSG (Static Site Generator)

The idea to bootstrap a site is using a template and markdown files (placed in a `data` folder), they will be pushed together to a Git repository, which will trigger static site service render the whole site together with contents embedded whenever you push new markdown posts to git

That means, you need to use git services to publish your posts, but without the need to write a backend or any CMS

I’m using [https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) as the starter, and modify some sites data (all data lies in `data` repo and tailwind css properties into a glassmorphism style with water marbles background that I randomly found on Unsplash

Maybe I will share how I feel about `tailwind-css`, to be honest, I think it’s better than my old fav css framework `styled-components`

## Sync Notion Notes to a Repo

The next question is how to sync the notion notes to a repo, and this is the whole point

I wrote a script here:

[https://github.com/wenwkich/fluidfeed-sync](https://github.com/wenwkich/fluidfeed-sync)

What this script does is that it will grab the markdown data with Notion API and save the markdown files to the local git repo, then you just need to use git commands to push the post

And I’m combining node script call and git stage, commit, push process into a Shortcut in my Mac and this really reduce a lot of friction when I publish a site

Just choose “Run shell script” and write scripts like this:

```shell
source ~/.zshrc
cd ~/ws/fluidfeed-sync
node sync.js
cd ~/ws/fluidfeed
git add .
git commit -m 'add posts'
git push
```

## Using Vercel to publish your site

I am stunned by how easy it is for Vercel to set up a site

I will give 100/10 for its user experience, the whole process runs very smoothly

You just need to log in with your Github Account, choose the Repo and it will immediately recognize the Next.js command and bang, your site is published

The whole process to publish a front end site is so easy that you don’t even need to read the documentation
