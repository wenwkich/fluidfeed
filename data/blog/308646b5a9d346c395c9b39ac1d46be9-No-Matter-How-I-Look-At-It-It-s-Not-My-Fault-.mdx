I have a few days to start my work, I have a few more full days to have fun with my blog (my blogs no longer looks empty now)

I suddenly notice one song — Petty Cvnt by Sewerslvt

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjtot639jxs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjtot639jxs)

I know it’s sampling from some Japanese animation ED, but I’m not an anime person, so I didn’t give much fuck about it, I just know Pretty Cvnt sounds filled with energies of hysteria, agony and tension, also somehow chaotic and disturbing to the normies, anyway not easy to listen (to me, I think that’s just sounds dramatic and unique)

I’m somehow curious today, and I just know today it’s from an anime called WataMote (**No Matter How I Look At It, It's Not My Fault!)**

I listen to the original songs with English Lyrics:

Just from the vibe of the original song, it sounds light and cute (although it’s about social anxiety about not being popular)

Wow, this song just sounds so like me a few years ago, if I found the anime earlier, I definitely will find more comfort in this series because it resonated with me but it’s somehow light and fun (bUt I dOn’T wAtCh ANIME)

YouTube random comment:

I didn’t watch the anime but from this song I just know what the show talks about

I agree.

Lyrics that has been used in Pretty Cvnt:

prelude: “I can’t even hold a conversation, I don’t know why... Am I an idiot?!”

hook: “Mirror mirror on the wall, do you want to shatter and fall?! You don’t have to say it all?!”

also hook: “(Mirror) You never reflect my beautiful inner self (It’s all in your head, it’s all in your head”

bridge: “Tomorrow will be the same as yesterday, I don’t know why... Am I an idiot?!”

The cutest part with the original song is that it was off-key at the end, sounds like she’s crying in a comedic way

But Pretty Cvnt change the whole vibe of being light and fun, turns the song into some kinda melodrama (also with the sample from Death Grips, “eat it like a devil’s cunt”, it’s just like telling me to just eat this shit and suck it up)

But I’m kinda over the state of being anxious about not being popular, right now I’m more listen to HyperPop and songs with “attitudes” butt sometimes listening to song that is this hysteric is cool too (I’m talking about Pretty Cvnt, not the anime ED)

To end this post, I just want to turn this blog with something filled with my personal inner experience and “mental model” (the [post](/blog/91b9d5aa442345dcad096b4e21764aa3-Simple-Not-Naive-Mental-Model-to-Private-Key-for-the-Non-Tech) of “Private key” should be my mental model only)
