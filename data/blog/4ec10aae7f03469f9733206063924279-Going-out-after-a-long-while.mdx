I finally went out today and grab something to eat. God, I was so used to ordering delivery for food.

I was going to watch Batman but the cinema is closed

Instead I went shopping for some clothes, and my feet hurts

My outing today ends with drinking Monster (normally I would drink Boba, I just created a brand new experience for myself to write this down)

- I think why I started to drink Monster is because Monster seems like to be for some ‘edgy’ people, I can’t drink alcohol and smoke anyway, if I want to be ‘edgy’, Monster/Red Bull seems like a good choice (I am so fucking immature)

While I was out, I was listening to songs and also brainstormed some ideas to write:

- Mood Rings by Lorde and the toxicity of wellness culture

- Metaverse and Metahuman

- TechLead

- Why do I still listen to artists that are ‘canceled’

- I’m getting started with mental models

- How logging down my thought process changed my life

- I need to fix my script because it obviously having scaling issue

- I think all products and frameworks all solves the issue of having friction

It looks like my brain is having some great inner experiences when I’m getting out alone

But I think I’ll save these leisure topic for weekends, right now it’s time to get down to business and study about web3

Well before that, maybe I need to check out “mental models”, why? Because I saw this [blog](<[https://theodorusclarence.com/blog/btb-flex-mental-model](https://theodorusclarence.com/blog/btb-flex-mental-model)>) about flexbox here and read the intro, but I will (might) read it later because I need to review flex box and know what does others mental model look like (I think the blog talking about private key is a example of my interpretation and hence, my mental model)
