IMO, the most important thing about web3 users to learn is private key, this article serves a simple but not naive explanation (with my understanding) to private key for the non-tech people

Many people understands cryptocurrency as they “encrypt” your “bitcoins”, and the private key is the password, which is not entirely true

---

## The similarity

They both give control and access to your account and needs to be kept confidential

---

## The difference

There are two main caveats about private key management, that key owners should protect their key from being _lost,_ as well as being _stolen_

Passwords can be always be reset by the centralized service provider, but this is not possible for private keys to be recovered if you just lost them

Same with password exploit, it can be reset as well if the service provider allows you with a centralized control, but not with private key, if a private key is stolen, you have to abandon it

With normal password infrastructure, your trust is given to the centralized authority, but with web3, devs can do nothing when you don’t keep your keys well

With a private key, you are given more responsibility to your web3 identity more than any web2 users. Everybody in web3 needs to have more common sense about what exactly does private key do

## The heart of Cryptography: one-way function as a black box

The premise of understanding the idea of asymmetric keys is to understand one-way function

How I usually see a function is a black box of some sort of mapping (`x → f(x)`), you don’t really have to drill down the detail in a function, but you really have to understand how it behaves

![](<[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Trapdoor_permutation.svg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Trapdoor_permutation.svg)>)

This picture shows the relationship of `x` and `f(x)` as a one-way function, from input to answer is very easy to compute, but from answer to its input is really hard to get, that’s one-way function’s behavior

A lot of functions in cryptographic world is one-way, such as hash functions, you can compute a hash given a word is given, but you cannot reverse the process

Also note that other basic properties of such functions are deterministic and non-corrlated (same input will generate same outcome and modification to input will generate another outcome), this property usually utilized for file hash to examine its integrity (because when file content changes, the hash will change too)

## Generation of Public and Private Key

Private key is very simple to understand, it’s just a random number from `1` to `2^256` (which is very large), one must be using a safe algorithm to generate a random number

This might surprise you, most random function in the programming language is not completely random, so we need an algo that is completely unpredictable

![](<[https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/raw/develop/images/simple_elliptic_curve.png](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/raw/develop/images/simple_elliptic_curve.png)>)

Public key requires more understanding, it basically is a point from the curve above, which is the product of elliptic curve "multiplication” between your private key and a constant point

It doesn’t matter if you don’t know what is an elliptic curve "multiplication”, because me neither

You just need to know this is not any other normal multiplication which is reversible, meaning elliptic curve "multiplication” is a one-way function

So you private key is the input to a black box and public key is the output, remember the property of one-way function, input to output is easy to get, but not vice versa

Note that `2^256` is a very big number, it is practically impossible for anyone to brute forcefully solve the private key when only a public key is given!

## Accounts & Ethereum Address

There are two account types in Ethereum, EOA (_externally owned accounts)_ and contract

We will only talk about EOA only, because this relates to this article the most

EOA is controlled by a private key and _digital signatures_

Your address is computed by another one-way function called `Keccak256` from public key, and we will take the last 20 bytes only

---

## Digital Signatures

This is how usually it works:

`sign` is a one-way function that is derived by a `message` (which is known) and `private key` (not known)

Anyone can `verify` the `message` by the `public key` with `signature`

You can not reverse the `private key` with `signature` and `message` provided

This is what is interesting about asymmetric encryption and signature, if Alice uses _public key_ to do something, Bob has to use _private key_; if Alice uses _private key_, then Bob has to use _public key_

This is why private key gives control to the EOA, a `transaction` could be signed with the `private key`, anyone who knows the public address can prove mathematically prove that this `transaction` is really issued by that EOA

This also ensures the private key never needs to leave the storage, you only broadcast the signature to the network, not your private keys, so **you will never need to send your private key / recovery phrases to others to sign a transaction!!!**

This gives a very different experience from traditional banking services, when you are doing customer services, you’ll always need to enter the password to the system / admin to confirm your identity, this will never happen in the decentralized world!

This is why the “MetaMask customer services” can’t fool me, I know I never need to give out my passphrase to anyone to grant access! So some common sense could really save you from the loss of fund
