Mama mia, it’s M.I.A. XXXO

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfbQ5mHWkOs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfbQ5mHWkOs)

This is not a nu song anymore, but gives me nostalgia all the way back to my high school days

This song still sounds pretty dope today also the music video is just iconic

It just looks very MySpace, it looks pretty old and cheesy on purpose (in 2012, MySpace is an early 2000 thing) to create that irony, but the songs sounds very ahead of its time which I think it’s just some kinda bad humor

The song talks about identities of social media, where women only reflect the gaze from other man (and I think vice versa nowadays)

(I want to write another blog about metaverse and identities and why do I think we are actually living in a metaverse already)

The verse is basically a woman flirting with a man on socials (the title XXXO just stands for “excess sex oh”) and the hook just repeating “you want me be, somebody who I’m really naut” which just reveal the truth and creates a stark contrast

Mai pick for the lines:

“I can be that actress and you’ll be Tarantino” - this is a clever line talking about Quentin Tarantino and Uma Thurman, celebrity gossips never get boring

“You want me be, somebody who I’m really not” - simple line, but very effectively delivers the whole concept

In my high school days, I already dislike social media a lot, because I was (and still am) very self-conscious and I don’t want people to judge me

Sometimes I don’t really want my stuff to grab attention but I think I’m getting more comfy with that by having dis blog

To be honest, I kinda want the layout of this site to be more like this music video (or like the tumblr days, but actually tumblr is pretty MK using Hong Kong slang), but I’m too lazy and I don’t think I have good aesthetic sense

To be honest, dis site kinda sucks as it looks too “standard” and just fits the current aesthetics

And the reason why I didn’t set up a comment system is that I am still self conscious and just lazy to reply and I hope no one will read them lol

Sorry if I don’t use enough adjectives because I’m not an adjective person (and my english bad bad)
